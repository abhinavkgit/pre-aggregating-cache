pre-aggregating-cache
=====================

The idea is to build a layer on top of a cache which provides pre-caching by predicting data flow paths  - Hope !! :) 

This is the initial draft of the readme - 14-October-2014

1.) Analyze data flow paths :
    a.) Schema analysis 
      - An excerpt of the idea is to predict the data flow based on schema structure and "expected" user behavior.
    b.) Behavioral analysis
      - Here we aim to do a intelligent learning of use patterns and build on trends to generate a caching plan.
    
2.) Based on above data build a caching mechanism which reduces response times.
